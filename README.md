# LeagueVision
This project aims to make ai visual recognition models for all things League of Legends.

## Description
LeagueVision is a comprehensive suite of Python scripts designed for image processing and machine learning. This project includes three main components:
1. A script for training machine learning models.
2. A script for generating images by modifying aspects of images in a specific folder.
3. A script for recognition purposes, leveraging the trained models.

## Features
- **Model Training**: Train your custom models with ease.
- **Image Generation**: Modify and generate images based on base data.
- **Image Recognition**: Utilize trained models to recognize and classify images.

## Current Focus and Image Availability
As of now, the primary focus of this project is on enhancing and expanding the capabilities related to champions images and items images. All the images for champions and items are readily available in the project repository, allowing for easy access and integration into the scripts. Users interested in these specific aspects can utilize these images for training, generation, and recognition purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- tensorflow
